# FS19 Web Stats - USABLE VERSION

## Update 10.05.2020 - what I changed:
- storage page change of css to make it look litle bit better when you click on item and submenu appears
- remove error "illegal offset" when you dont have all animals on farm
- remove error "illegal offset" when you dont play your farm more than 4 day to display 5 day summary
- add proper calculation for actual value of food in %, to correctly display a food progress bar
- change in css to display animal image correctly
- I hope that this version has no error so far...
- you need to add configuration to you dedicated server farm (naming of selling points and also farmlands prices)
- you may also need some xml with translations for your DS mods
- various issue correction see commits
